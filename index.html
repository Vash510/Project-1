                <p>Thomas Edward Lawrence was a British officer stationed in the Middle-East during World War 1. He is most well known for the Arab Revolt and the Sinai and Plestine Champaign 
                    against the Ottoman Empire.</p>

                        <h3>Early-life</h3>
                        <p>Lawrence was born on 16 August 1888 in Wales. Lawrenece being born out of wedlock was an outsider in the Victorian-Edwardian British society. Lawrence's parents were not, and never married, which was abnormal for the time. His father inherited a baronetcy at 
                            Killua Castle in Westmeath, Ireland. This would aid in his ability to articulate himself in his writing.The family lived at Langley Lodge (now demolished) from 1894 to 1896, set in private woods between the eastern borders of the New Forest and Southampton Water in Hampshire.
                            The residence was isolated, and young Lawrence had many opportunities for outdoor activities and waterfront visits.

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>
                        At age 15, Lawrence and his firend Cyril Beeson found themselves studing local church's monuments and antiquities. Lawrence and Beeson reported findings around church sites 
                        donating items to the church. They even toured France, colllecting photographs and measurments of castles.

                    <p>
                        Lawrence studied history at Jesus College, Oxford, continuing his study of castles. In the Summer of 1909 he set out, alone, on a three month study of crusader castles in 
                        Ottoman Syria. He traveled over 1000 mi on foot during this study. He graduated with First Class Honours after submitting his thesis titled <em>The Influence if the Crusades 
                        on European Military Architecture-to the End of the 12th Century</em>. Lawrence was facinated by the Middle-Ages.

                    <p>In 1910 Lawrence was offered the oppurtunity to become a practicing archieologist at Carchrmish. While there he learned Aribic and gained a large amount of experience 
                        commanding an expidition. At Carchemish, Lawrence was frequently involved in a high-tension relationship with a German-led team working nearby on the Baghdad Railway at Jerablus. 
                        While there was never open combat, there was regular conflict over access to land and treatment of the local workforce; Lawrence gained experience in Middle Eastern leadership practices and conflict resolution

                        In January 1914, Woolley and Lawrence were co-opted by the British military as an archaeological smokescreen for a British military survey of the Negev Desert.

                        Following the outbreak of hostilities in August 1914, Lawrence did not immediately enlist in the British Army. The situation was complex during 1915. There was a growing Arab-nationalist movement within the 
                        Arabic-speaking Ottoman territories, including many Arabs serving in the Ottoman armed forces.

                <h3>Begining of the Arab Revolt</h3>
                <p>
                    The Arab Revolt began in June 1916, but it bogged down after a few successes, with a real risk that the Ottoman forces would advance along the coast of the Red Sea and recapture Mecca.
                    On 16 October 1916, Lawrence was sent to the Hejaz on an intelligence-gathering mission led by Ronald Storrs. He interviewed Sharif Hussein's sons Ali, Abdullah, and Faisal, and he 
                    concluded that Faisal was the best candidate to lead the Revolt. Lawrence's most important contributions to the Arab Revolt were in the area of strategy and liaison with British 
                    armed forces, but he also participated personally in several military engagements. Lawrence made a 300-mile personal journey northward in June 1917, on the way to Aqaba, visiting 
                    Ras Baalbek, the outskirts of Damascus, and Azraq, Jordan.

                <h3>Arab Revolt: Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                    The chief elements of the Arab strategy which Faisal and Lawrence developed were to avoid capturing Medina, and to extend northwards through Maan and Dera'a to Damascus and beyond. Medina was an attractive target for the revolt as Islam's second holiest site, and because its Ottoman garrison was weakened by disease and isolation.
                    It became clear that it was advantageous to leave it there rather than try to capture it, while continually attacking the Hejaz railway south from Damascus without permanently destroying it. This prevented the Ottomans from 
                    making effective use of their troops at Medina, and forced them to dedicate many resources to defending and repairing the railway line.

                    "The value of the tribes is defensive only and their real sphere is guerilla warfare. They are intelligent, and very lively, almost reckless, but too individualistic to endure commands, or fight in line, or to help each other. 
                    It would, I think, be possible to make an organized force out of them.… The Hejaz war is one of dervishes against regular forces—and we are on the side of the dervishes. Our text-books do not apply to its conditions at all."

                <h3>Capture of Aqaba</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1917, Lawrence proposed a joint action with the Arab irregulars and forces including Auda Abu Tayi, who had previously been in the employ of the Ottomans, against the strategically located but lightly defended town of Aqaba on the Red Sea. 
                    Lawrence carefully avoided informing his British superiors about the details of the planned inland attack, due to concern that it would be blocked as contrary to French interests. The expedition departed from Wejh on 9 May,[102] and Aqaba fell 
                    to the Arab forces on 6 July, after a surprise overland attack which took the Turkish defences from behind. After Aqaba, General Sir Edmund Allenby, the new commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, agreed to Lawrence's strategy 
                    for the revolt. Lawrence now held a powerful position as an adviser to Faisal and a person who had Allenby's confidence
