                <p>Thomas Edward Lawrence was a British officer stationed in the Middle-East during World War 1. He is most well known for the Arab Revolt and the Sinai and Plestine Champaign 
                    against the Ottoman Empire.</p>

                        <h3>Early-life</h3>
                        <p>Lawrence was born on 16 August 1888 in Wales. Lawrence's parents were not, and never married, which was abnormal for the time. His father inherited a baronetcy at 
                            Killua Castle in Westmeath, Ireland. Lawrenece being born out of wedlock was an outsider in the Victorian-Edwardian British society. This would aid in his ability to articulate
                            himself in his writing.

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>
                        At age 15, Lawrence and his firend Cyril Beeson found themselves studing local church's monuments and antiquities. Lawrence and Beeson reported findings around church sites 
                        donating items to the church. They even toured France, colllecting photographs and measurments of castles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lawrence studied history at Jesus College, Oxford, continuing his study of castles. In the Summer of 1909 he set out, alone, on a three month study of crusader castles in 
                        Ottoman Syria. He traveled over 1000 mi on foot during this study. He graduated with First Class Honours after submitting his thesis titled <em>The Influence if the Crusades 
                        on European Military Architecture-to the End of the 12th Century</em>. Lawrence was facinated by the Middle-Ages.

                    <h3>Pre-war</h3>
                    <p>In 1910 Lawrence was offered the oppurtunity to become a practicing archieologist at Carchrmish. While there he learned Aribic and gained a large amount of experience 
                        commanding an expidition. Frequent conflicts with the neighboring German archielogical team working nearby taught Lawrence alot about conflict resolution.
